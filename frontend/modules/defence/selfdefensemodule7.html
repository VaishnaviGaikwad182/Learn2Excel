            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Understanding self-defense laws is crucial for knowing your legal rights and responsibilities when
                protecting yourself or others. This module explores key legal principles, differences in laws across
                regions, and the conditions under which force can be legally justified.
                The goal is to equip individuals with the knowledge to act lawfully and responsibly in self-defense
                situations while avoiding unnecessary legal consequences.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="self-defense-laws">
            <h2> Understanding Self-Defense Laws</h2>
            <p>
                This section covers the foundational legal aspects of self-defense, including key doctrines and
                principles that determine when the use of force is considered lawful.
            </p><br>

            <h3>Concept of Justifiable Use of Force</h3>
            <p>
                Self-defense laws allow individuals to use reasonable force to protect themselves, others, or their
                property from harm. However, the force used must be proportional to the threat faced.
                Courts typically assess factors such as the severity of the threat, whether the individual was the
                initial aggressor, and if there were opportunities to escape before resorting to force.
            </p><br>

            <h3>Differences in Self-Defense Laws by Country/Region</h3>
            <p>
                Self-defense laws vary widely across different countries and even among states within the same country.
                Some regions have stricter laws requiring individuals to avoid confrontation when possible, while others
                provide broad legal protections for using force in self-defense.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>United States:</strong> Many states follow "Stand Your Ground" or "Castle Doctrine" laws,
                    allowing individuals to defend themselves without retreating.</li>
                <li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> Self-defense is permitted, but the force used must be "reasonable,"
                    and there is an expectation to retreat when possible.</li>
                <li><strong>India:</strong> The Indian Penal Code (IPC) permits self-defense under Section 96-106, but
                    excessive force can still lead to legal consequences.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Countries:</strong> Some nations have highly restrictive laws, requiring victims to
                    prove they had no choice but to act in self-defense.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Duty to Retreat vs. Stand Your Ground Laws</h3>
            <p>
                Different jurisdictions have different approaches to self-defense when escape is an option:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Duty to Retreat:</strong> In some places, individuals must try to escape or avoid
                    confrontation before using force. If escape is possible but the individual chooses to fight, they
                    may face legal consequences.</li>
                <li><strong>Stand Your Ground:</strong> These laws remove the requirement to retreat, allowing
                    individuals to use force (including lethal force) when they perceive a threat, even if they could
                    have escaped.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Castle Doctrine and Home Defense</h3>
            <p>
                The Castle Doctrine is a legal principle that allows individuals to use force, including deadly force,
                to protect their home from intruders without the obligation to retreat. Key aspects include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Home as a Safe Haven:</strong> A person does not need to retreat when faced with an intruder
                    in their home.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of Deadly Force:</strong> In many cases, homeowners can use deadly force if they believe
                    the intruder poses a serious threat.</li>
                <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Some jurisdictions only allow force if the intruder is unlawfully and
                    forcibly entering the home.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                By understanding these legal principles, individuals can make informed decisions in self-defense
                situations while ensuring they stay within the bounds of the law.

        <section id="legal-consequences">
            <h2> Legal Consequences of Self-Defense Actions</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding the legal implications of self-defense is crucial to ensuring that actions taken in an
                emergency do not lead to criminal or civil liability.
                This section explores when self-defense crosses the line into excessive force, the differences between
                civil and criminal liability, the role of evidence in legal defense, and real-world case studies of
                justified and unlawful use of force.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="excessive-force">
            <h2>When Self-Defense Becomes Excessive Force</h2>
            <p>
                The law allows self-defense only when it is **reasonable and proportional** to the threat faced.
                Excessive force occurs when:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The response is significantly greater than necessary to neutralize the threat.</li>
                <li>Force continues to be applied even after the attacker is subdued.</li>
                <li>Retaliation is involved rather than immediate self-protection.</li>
                <li>The individual initiates a conflict and then claims self-defense unjustifiably.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Courts assess whether a **reasonable person in the same situation** would have acted similarly before
                determining if force was excessive.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="civil-vs-criminal-liability">
            <h2>Civil vs. Criminal Liability in Self-Defense Cases</h2>
            <p>
                A person using force in self-defense may face **criminal charges** or **civil lawsuits** depending on
                the situation:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Criminal Liability:</strong> If the self-defense claim is invalid (e.g., excessive force,
                    premeditated attack), the person may be charged with assault, manslaughter, or murder.</li>
                <li><strong>Civil Liability:</strong> Even if criminal charges are dropped, the person may face civil
                    lawsuits for damages (e.g., medical bills, wrongful death claims).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Some legal doctrines, such as **Stand Your Ground laws**, offer immunity from civil lawsuits if the use
                of force is legally justified.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="evidence-and-witnesses">
            <h2>Role of Evidence & Witnesses in Self-Defense Claims</h2>
            <p>
                Proving a self-defense claim in court often depends on the quality of available evidence and witness
                testimony. Important factors include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Evidence:</strong> Injuries, security footage, weapon placement, and forensic
                    reports.</li>
                <li><strong>Eyewitnesses:</strong> Testimonies from neutral observers can support or contradict
                    self-defense claims.</li>
                <li><strong>911 Call & Police Reports:</strong> Immediate reports can establish the sequence of events.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Defendant's Statements:</strong> What is said to law enforcement immediately after an
                    incident can impact the case.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A well-documented case with strong evidence increases the chances of proving self-defense in court.
            </p>

        <section id="case-studies">
            <h2>Case Studies of Legal Self-Defense vs. Illegal Use of Force</h2>
            <p>
                Examining real-world cases helps illustrate how courts differentiate between lawful self-defense and
                unlawful aggression:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case 1 (Justified Self-Defense):</strong> A homeowner shot an armed intruder in a "Castle
                    Doctrine" state and was cleared of charges.</li>
                <li><strong>Case 2 (Excessive Force):</strong> A man continued to attack an unarmed burglar after
                    disarming him, leading to manslaughter charges.</li>
                <li><strong>Case 3 (Stand Your Ground):</strong> A driver used deadly force during a road rage incident
                    but was acquitted due to Stand Your Ground laws.</li>
                <li><strong>Case 4 (Misuse of Self-Defense Claim):</strong> A person provoked a fight, then used force
                    and falsely claimed self-defense but was convicted of assault.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These cases highlight the importance of acting lawfully and responsibly in self-defense situations.

            <p>
                Understanding self-defense laws and techniques is crucial for personal safety and legal protection.
                While the right to defend oneself is universally recognized, it comes with legal and ethical
                responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                By staying informed about the principles of proportional force, duty to retreat, and legal distinctions
                between justified and excessive self-defense, individuals can make sound decisions in high-pressure
                situations. Additionally, psychological preparedness plays a key role in handling such encounters
                effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether defending oneself, protecting others, or ensuring the safety of vulnerable groups, responsible
                self-defense practices help maintain personal security while staying within legal boundaries.
