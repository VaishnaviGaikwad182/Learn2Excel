            <h2>Introduction </h2>
            <p>Defensive stance and footwork are fundamental skills essential for maintaining stability, agility, and
                control in various sports and self-defense situations. A strong defensive stance provides a solid
                foundation, allowing individuals to react quickly and efficiently to opponents’ movements. Proper
                footwork enhances mobility, enabling smooth transitions between offensive and defensive actions while
                conserving energy.<br><br>

                Mastering these techniques improves balance, positioning, and reflexes, reducing the risk of injuries
                and ensuring better overall performance. Whether in martial arts, sports, or everyday scenarios,
                understanding and practicing defensive stance and footwork empower individuals with confidence and
                control.</p>

            <h2>Role of Footwork in Maintaining Balance and Agility</h2>
            <p>Footwork plays a vital role in ensuring balance and agility during movement. Proper foot placement
                allows you to maintain stability, reposition quickly, and avoid losing control during defensive
                maneuvers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhances mobility, allowing for quick directional changes.</li>
                <li>Helps maintain a strong base to absorb impact and remain steady.</li>
                <li>Reduces the risk of stumbling or being pushed off balance.</li>
                <li>Enables efficient weight distribution for controlled movements.</li>
