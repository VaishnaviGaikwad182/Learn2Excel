            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Self-defense against multiple attackers requires a strategic and composed approach. This module equips
                individuals with the awareness, movement tactics, and defensive strategies necessary to manage threats
                from more than one person. The focus is on staying mobile, avoiding entrapment, using the environment
                wisely, and identifying escape routes. Enhancing quick decision-making and targeting the most immediate
                threats can increase survival and safety in real-world scenarios.</p>

                <p>
                    When faced with more than one attacker, specific principles can improve your chances of defense:
                </p>
                <li>Maintain Movement: Constant movement prevents attackers from surrounding or cornering you.</li>
                <li>Control Distance: Use footwork to keep attackers at a manageable distance, reducing simultaneous
                    attacks.</li>
                <li>Use One Attacker as a Shield: Position one attacker between you and others to limit exposure.</li>
                <li>Exploit Environmental Advantages: Use walls, narrow spaces, or objects to block or slow attackers.
                </li>
                <li>Prioritize Escape: The ultimate goal is not to win, but to escape safely. Strike effectively and
                    disengage quickly.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Strategies for Facing Multiple Attackers</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>When confronted with more than one attacker, staying mobile and thinking tactically is vital.
                    Here’s how to respond effectively:</p>

                <li><strong>Movement & Evasion:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Circle Movement:</em> Constantly reposition yourself to prevent being surrounded.
                        </li>
                        <li><em>Use of Obstacles:</em> Put physical barriers like chairs, bins, or parked bikes
                            between you and your attackers.</li>
                        <li><em>Angle Shifting:</em> Step diagonally or side-to-side to stay unpredictable and
                            create distance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Strikes & Distractions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Target Weak Spots:</em> Quick strikes to the eyes, nose, or throat can disorient
                            attackers temporarily.</li>
                        <li><em>Low Kicks:</em> Attack the knees or shins to slow down or drop an opponent.</li>
                        <li><em>Distraction Techniques:</em> Use loud noises, throw nearby objects, or push one
                            attacker into another to break their coordination.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <p>Remember, the main objective is not to "win" but to survive, escape, and report the incident
                    safely.</p>

            <h2>Recovery & Regaining Control Amid Multiple Attackers</h2>

            <ul>
                <p>In situations involving more than one attacker, recovering quickly and safely is critical. These
                    techniques help you regain control without exposing yourself:</p>

                <li><strong>Strategic Stand-Up:</strong> Perform a technical stand-up while keeping your eyes on all
                    potential threats to avoid surprise attacks.</li>

                <li><strong>Momentum Roll Recovery:</strong> Use a backward or sideways roll to create space and
                    reposition yourself away from attackers.</li>

                <li><strong>Shield and Rise:</strong> Use your leg or an object as a barrier while getting up to prevent
                    attackers from closing in.</li>

                <p>These methods help you recover while maintaining awareness, allowing you to escape or prepare for
                    further defense.</p>

            <h2>Practical Drills & Reflex Training for Multiple Attackers</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>Quick reflexes and strategic movement are essential when facing more than one attacker. Key training
                    drills include:</p>

                <li><strong>Multi-Attacker Drills:</strong> Practice defending against attacks from different angles to
                    develop 360-degree awareness.</li>

                <li><strong>Scenario-Based Reflex Training:</strong> Simulate real-life multiple-threat situations to
                    improve decision-making and movement speed.</li>

                <li><strong>Combination Defense Techniques:</strong> Integrate blocks, strikes, and evasion to react
                    fluidly under pressure.</li>

                <p>These drills build instinctive reactions and sharpen situational awareness for handling complex
                    threat scenarios.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="scenarioLearning">
            <h2>Scenario-Based Learning: Facing Multiple Attackers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Surrounded by two attackers — use <em>circular footwork</em> to
                    avoid being
                    trapped and keep one attacker between you and the others.</li>

                <li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> One attacker grabs you while another approaches — apply a quick
                    <em>release
                        technique</em> followed by a <em>push kick</em> to create distance.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> Attackers attempt to corner you near a wall — use <em>lateral
                        movement</em> and
                    target the nearest threat first to break the formation.</li>

                <li><strong>Scenario 4:</strong> Facing three attackers — use <em>targeted strikes</em> on
                    vulnerable areas
                    (knees, eyes, groin) and seek an exit route.</li>

                <li><strong>Scenario 5:</strong> Escaping a group attack — rely on <em>quick reflexes, environmental
                        awareness,</em> and <em>verbal de-escalation</em> to buy time and safely disengage.</li>
            </ul>
