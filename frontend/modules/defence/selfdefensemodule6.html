        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Ground defense is essential for handling situations where an individual is taken down or pinned. This
                module focuses on defensive positions, escape strategies, and recovery techniques to regain control. By
                learning proper body mechanics and leverage, individuals can defend effectively and transition from
                defense to offense. The goal is to enhance situational awareness, quick reflexes, and confidence in
                real-world scenarios while ensuring safety.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="defense position">
            <h2>Defensive Ground Positions</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    When on the ground, positioning is key to reducing vulnerability. Defensive stances include:
                </p>
                <li>The Guard Position: Keeping the attacker between your legs to control their movement.</li>
                <li>Side Position: Turning sideways to create space and protect vital areas.</li>
                <li>Turtle Position: Curling inward to protect the head and torso while preparing for an escape.
                    Maintaining a strong posture and staying mobile are crucial in preventing further attacks.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="footwork">
            <h2>Escaping Common Ground Holes</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>Attackers may use different holds to restrain you. Common scenarios include:</p>
                <li>Escaping a Mounted Position: Use hip thrusts and leverage to unbalance the attacker.</li>
                <li>Breaking Free from a Headlock: Turn your chin towards their grip, strike vulnerable areas, and
                    leverage their arm.</li>
                <li>Defending Against an Attacker on Your Chest: Push against their hips, use knee strikes, or roll to
                    escape.</li>
                <p>These techniques focus on using body mechanics and an attacker’s force against them.</p>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="angles and barriers">
            <h2> Effective Strikes & Counters from the Ground</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>Being grounded does not mean being defenseless. Key attacks include:</p>
                <li>Palm Strikes: Aiming for the attacker’s face or chin.</li>
                <li>Elbow Strikes: Targeting the ribs or face from close range.</li>
                <li>Knee Kicks: Striking the attacker’s legs to destabilize them.
                    Striking the right points at the right time helps create an opportunity to escape.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="recoveryTechniques">
            <h2>Recovery & Getting Back on Your Feet</h2>

            <ul>
                <p>After escaping an attack, standing up safely is essential. Recovery techniques include:</p>

                <li>Technical Stand-Up: Placing one hand on the ground while using the opposite foot to push up.</li>
                <li>Backward Roll to Standing: Using momentum to roll back and stand quickly.</li>
                <li>Knee Shield Defense: Keeping an attacker at a distance while preparing to get up.
                    These techniques ensure that you regain balance and avoid further threats.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="practicalDrills">

            <h2>Practical Drills & Reflex Training</h2>
            <ul>
                <p> Reflexes and muscle memory play a crucial role in self-defense. Exercises include:</p>
                <li>Partner Drills: Practicing escapes and counters in a controlled environment.</li>
                <li>Reaction Training: Simulating sudden attacks to improve quick thinking.</li>
                <li>Ground Defense Combinations: Mixing different techniques for efficient execution.
                    Consistent practice ensures the ability to respond instinctively during an attack.</li>

            <h2>Scenario-Based Learning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You are walking through a deserted street when a stranger approaches
                    aggressively. Use <em>situational awareness</em> to identify escape routes and move toward a safer
                    location.</li>
                <li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> An attacker suddenly grabs your wrist tightly. Use a <em>wrist
                        release</em> technique to break free and quickly step back.</li>
                <li><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> A person attempts to push you forcefully. Utilize a <em>side step</em>
                    to avoid the push and reposition yourself defensively.</li>
                <li><strong>Scenario 4:</strong> An attacker tries to grab you from behind. Use a <em>knee strike</em>
                    to their lower body, creating an opportunity to escape.</li>
                <li><strong>Scenario 5:</strong> You are confronted by multiple attackers. Use <em>footwork and
                        positioning</em> to keep one attacker in front of you while preparing for self-defense moves.
