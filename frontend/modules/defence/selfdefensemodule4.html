A tactical pen is even more effective due to its reinforced body. It can be used for pressure point control to inflict pain and force an attacker to back off. Even an ordinary pen, when used forcefully, can cause injury. It is a common item, making it a discreet self-defense tool. If necessary, it can also be thrown as a distraction.", img: "/frontend/assets/images/self-defense/pen.jfif" },

Shoes provide natural protection and stability for self-defense situations. Kicking with proper technique can generate significant force to incapacitate an attacker. Shoes with metal reinforcements can increase their effectiveness. They are always worn, making them a readily available tool.
