        <h2> Module Objectives:</h2>
        <p>
            By the end of this module, learners will:<br>
            ✅ Develop the habit of scanning their surroundings for threats.<br>
            ✅ Recognize early warning signs of danger and respond effectively.<br>
            ✅ Use risk assessment techniques to avoid unsafe situations.<br>
            ✅ Apply situational awareness skills in real-world scenarios.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Situational Awareness?</h2>
        <p>Situational awareness is the ability to <strong>perceive, understand, and respond</strong> to what is
            happening in your environment. It involves recognizing potential threats, identifying risks, and making
            informed decisions to stay safe. This skill is crucial in self-defense as it allows individuals to recognize
            danger before it escalates, giving them a chance to avoid, de-escalate, or prepare for a response.
        </p>

        <p>Situational awareness is not about being paranoid—it’s about <span class="highlight">being alert, prepared,
            and proactive</span>. It helps individuals stay in control of their surroundings, whether they are
            walking alone at night, using public transport, or navigating crowded places.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is it Important in Self-Defense?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prevention Over Reaction:</strong> Recognizing a threat in advance allows you to avoid a
                dangerous situation rather than reacting under pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Decision-Making:</strong> Aware individuals can assess situations quickly and decide
                the safest course of action.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduces Vulnerability:</strong> Attackers often look for distracted or unaware individuals.
                Staying alert makes you a less likely target.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhances Quick Reflexes:</strong> When you are aware, you can respond effectively, whether it’s
                moving away, calling for help, or preparing to defend yourself.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Introduction to Situational Awareness</h2>
            <li><strong>What is Situational Awareness?</strong> – Situational awareness is the ability to observe,
                comprehend, and anticipate events in your surroundings to ensure personal safety. It involves staying
                alert and recognizing potential risks before they escalate.</li>
            <li><strong>The Three Levels of Situational Awareness:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Perception:</strong> Noticing details in your environment, such as people’s behavior,
                        unusual activities, or environmental hazards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comprehension:</strong> Understanding what those details mean and how they could affect
                        your safety.</li>
                    <li><strong>Projection:</strong> Predicting what might happen next and planning an appropriate
                        response.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Why is Situational Awareness Important?</strong> – Being aware helps prevent dangerous
                situations, allows for quick decision-making, and enhances overall personal security.</li>
            <li><strong>Factors That Reduce Situational Awareness:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distractions like mobile phone usage while walking.</li>
                    <li>Fatigue or stress, which impairs quick decision-making.</li>
                    <li>Overconfidence in assuming nothing bad can happen.</li>
                    <li>Familiarity with a place, leading to a false sense of security.</li>
                    <li>Alcohol or drug use that impairs judgment and reaction time.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <li><strong>Trust Your Instincts:</strong> If something feels off, take action to remove yourself
                        from the situation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identify Exits:</strong> Whenever entering a building, note the nearest exit routes.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Tunnel Vision:</strong> Be aware of what's happening 360° around you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limit Distractions:</strong> Avoid using headphones at high volume or texting while
                        walking in unfamiliar areas.</li>
                </ul>

                                aggressive behavior from strangers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Situational Risks</strong> – Being alone at night, carrying valuables visibly,
                                or using a phone in an unsafe area.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Types of Threats:</strong>

                            <li><strong>Digital Threats</strong> – Cyber-attacks, phishing, identity theft, or online
                                harassment.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Mitigation Strategies:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Avoid isolated or poorly lit areas when walking alone.</li>
                            <li>Keep emergency contacts saved on your phone.</li>
                            <li>Be aware of exits and escape routes in crowded places.</li>
                            <li>Secure personal belongings and avoid displaying valuables.</li>
                            <li>Use strong passwords and be cautious of suspicious online messages.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Reading Body Language:</strong> Recognizing suspicious behavior, such as nervous
                        movements, excessive glancing, or avoidance of eye contact, can help assess threats early.
                        Someone standing too close or mirroring your actions can also be a sign of potential danger.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Planning:</strong> Having a plan in place for emergencies is crucial. Learn
                        the location of emergency exits, carry self-defense tools where legally allowed, and establish a
                        check-in system with family or friends when traveling alone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine you are in a parking garage at night. What steps should you
                        take to ensure your safety?
