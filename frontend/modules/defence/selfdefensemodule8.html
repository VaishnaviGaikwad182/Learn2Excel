                Women face various threats, including physical, verbal, and online harassment. Understanding these
                risks can help in taking preventive measures. Key threats include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Street Harassment and Stalking:</strong> Catcalling, unwanted advances, and persistent

                <li><strong>Workplace Harassment and Discrimination:</strong> Sexual harassment, gender
                    discrimination, and inappropriate behavior can impact professional growth and mental well-being.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding self-defense laws and techniques is crucial for personal safety and legal protection.
                While the right to defend oneself is universally recognized, it comes with legal and ethical
                responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                By staying informed about the principles of proportional force, duty to retreat, and legal
                distinctions between justified and excessive self-defense, individuals can make sound decisions in
                high-pressure situations. Additionally, psychological preparedness plays a key role in handling such
                encounters effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether defending oneself, protecting others, or ensuring the safety of vulnerable groups,
                responsible self-defense practices help maintain personal security while staying within legal
                boundaries.
