    <div class="box">
        <h3>8.1 Understanding Financial Goals</h3>
        <p>Financial goals are specific monetary objectives individuals aim to achieve within a certain time frame. They
            give direction to your financial planning and help you measure progress.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Short-Term Goals (0–3 Years):</strong> These include creating an emergency fund, repaying small
                debts, or saving for a gadget or vacation. They offer quick wins and build financial discipline.</li>
            <li><strong>Medium-Term Goals (3–10 Years):</strong> Involve bigger milestones like saving for a down
                payment on a house, starting a small business, or higher education. These require planning and
                disciplined saving.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Goals (10+ Years):</strong> Focus on retirement planning, achieving financial
                independence, or leaving a legacy. These need consistent investing and patience to grow wealth over
                time.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h3>8.2 Steps to Achieve Financial Goals</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Set SMART Goals:</strong> Ensure your goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and
                Time-bound. For example, "Save ₹5,00,000 in 5 years for higher education."</li>
            <li><strong>Create a Budget:</strong> Track monthly income and expenses. Allocate money to savings before
                spending. Use budgeting tools or apps to stay consistent.</li>
            <li><strong>Save & Invest Wisely:</strong> Automate savings so that a portion of your income goes directly
                into investments like mutual funds or recurring deposits. Begin early to benefit from compounding.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce Debt:</strong> Pay off high-interest loans (like credit cards) first. Avoid taking
                unnecessary debt and aim to maintain a good credit score.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor & Adjust:</strong> Review your financial goals every 6–12 months. Update your goals
                based on life events like marriage, job change, or kids’ education.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h3>8.3 Wealth-Building Strategies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Save Consistently:</strong> Aim to save at least 20–30% of your monthly income. Set up automatic
                transfers to savings or investment accounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Diversify Investments:</strong> Don’t rely on just one asset. Spread investments across stocks,
                mutual funds, gold, real estate, and fixed deposits to reduce risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Create Multiple Income Streams:</strong> Consider side hustles like freelancing, renting
                property, affiliate marketing, or investing in dividend-paying stocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance & Estate Planning:</strong> Protect your wealth with adequate health and life
                insurance. Create a will to ensure your assets are passed on as per your wishes.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Education:</strong> Stay informed about personal finance, taxes, and investment
                strategies. Regular learning helps avoid scams and poor decisions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h3>8.4 Investment Options for Wealth Growth</h3>
        <p>Choose investment options based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed-Income (Low Risk):</strong> Fixed Deposits (FDs), Public Provident Fund (PPF), and
                Government Bonds offer stable returns with minimal risk—ideal for short- to medium-term goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Market-Linked (Moderate to High Risk):</strong> Mutual Funds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), and
                Stocks offer higher returns but come with risks. Suitable for long-term goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative Investments:</strong> Real estate provides rental income and long-term appreciation.
                Gold is a hedge against inflation. Digital assets like cryptocurrency are high-risk and should be
                approached cautiously.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="box warning">
        <h3>8.5 Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Clear Plan:</strong> Not defining specific goals can lead to poor financial choices and
                delayed progress.</li>
            <li><strong>Spending More Than You Earn:</strong> Overspending leads to debt accumulation and hampers your
                ability to save.</li>
            <li><strong>Delaying Investments:</strong> Postponing investments means losing out on the benefits of
                compounding.</li>
            <li><strong>One Source of Income:</strong> Relying only on a salary is risky. Build additional income
                streams for stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Ignoring Inflation:</strong> Keeping all savings in low-interest accounts can reduce purchasing
                power over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Following Unverified Advice:</strong> Always research before making financial decisions. Don’t
                blindly follow trends or influencers.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h3>8.6 Tools & Apps for Financial Goal Tracking</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Budgeting Apps:</strong> Try apps like Walnut, Goodbudget, or Mint to monitor your spending.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Goal-Setting Tools:</strong> Use platforms like ET Money, Groww, or Paytm Money to plan
                investments and track financial goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Spreadsheets:</strong> Create custom Google Sheets or Excel files to manually track savings,
                expenses, and milestones.</li>
        </ul>
