                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    In today's financial landscape, understanding credit, loans, and debt management is essential for
                    achieving personal and professional goals. Whether you're planning to buy a home, finance your
                    education, or start a business, leveraging credit responsibly can provide numerous opportunities.
                    However, if not managed properly, debt can lead to financial stress and long-term difficulties. This
                    module explains the basics of credit and loans and offers strategies to manage and reduce debt
                    effectively.

                <h2>What is Credit?</h2>
                <p>Credit refers to the ability to borrow money or access goods and services with a promise to pay
                    later. Credit is often extended through credit cards, lines of credit, and other financial products.
                    Credit scores play a crucial role in determining an individual's creditworthiness, which is assessed
                    based on repayment history, outstanding debts, and financial behavior.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A high credit score increases the chances of getting loans with favorable interest rates, while a
                    poor credit score can lead to loan rejections or higher interest rates. Responsible credit usage
                    includes paying bills on time, keeping credit utilization low, and avoiding unnecessary debt
                    accumulation.</p>
                <h3>Key Points:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Credit allows you to borrow funds from lenders.</li>
                    <li>It requires a commitment to repay the borrowed amount with interest.</li>
                    <li>Your creditworthiness is evaluated through your credit history and credit score.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="example-card">
                    <h3>💳 Credit Example: Credit Card Usage</h3>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Sarah has a ₹1,60,000 credit card limit. She spends ₹1,20,000 but only
                        pays ₹8,000.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interest:</strong> ₹1,870 will be charged on the remaining ₹1,12,000.</p>
                    <p>If she only pays the minimum, the debt will keep increasing!</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Loans: Types and Terms</h2>
                <p>A loan is a sum of money borrowed from a lender, such as a bank, financial institution, or private
                    lender, with an agreement to repay it over time, usually with interest. Loans can be of various
                    types, including personal loans, home loans, education loans, and business loans.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Each loan type comes with specific terms, including repayment tenure, interest rates, and eligibility
                    criteria. Borrowers must carefully assess their financial situation before taking a loan to ensure
                    they can manage the repayments without financial stress.</p>
                <h3>Common Loan Types:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal Loans:</strong> Unsecured loans for various personal needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Auto Loans:</strong> Secured loans for purchasing vehicles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Home Loans/Mortgages:</strong> Long-term loans for home purchases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Student Loans:</strong> For education expenses, often with deferred repayment terms.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="example-card">
                    <h3>📌 Loan Example: Education Loan</h3>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Aman takes a ₹8,00,000 loan at 5% interest for 5 years.</p>
                    <p><strong>Calculation:</strong> Using the EMI formula:</p>
                    <p>EMI = ₹{{calculated EMI}}</p>
                    <p>He will need to pay this amount monthly after his moratorium period.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Interest Rates and Repayment</h2>
                <p>Understanding how interest rates affect your loan repayments is crucial. Fixed rates remain the same
                    throughout the loan term, while variable rates can change with market fluctuations.</p>

                <h3>Important Concepts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>APR (Annual Percentage Rate):</strong> APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It tells
                        you the total cost of borrowing money in a year — not just the interest rate, but also any
                        additional fees or charges involved.</li>
                    <li><strong>EMI (Equated Monthly Installment):</strong> EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment.
                        It’s the fixed amount you pay to your lender every month until your loan is fully paid off.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Credit Scores and Reports</h2>
                <p>Your credit score reflects your creditworthiness and is vital for securing loans with favorable
                    terms. It’s calculated based on payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, new
                    credit, and types of credit used.</p>

                <h3>How to Maintain a Good Credit Score:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pay bills on time.</li>
                    <li>Keep credit card balances low.</li>
                    <li>Avoid opening too many accounts at once.</li>
                    <li>Regularly check your credit report for errors.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Debt Management Strategies</h2>
                <p>Debt management involves strategies to handle outstanding loans and credit obligations efficiently.
                    Poor debt management can lead to financial difficulties, high-interest costs, and even legal
                    consequences. Effective debt management includes timely repayment of loans, prioritizing
                    high-interest debts, negotiating better loan terms, and consolidating multiple debts into a single
                    manageable payment.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Budgeting and financial planning are crucial to ensure that debt does not become overwhelming. In
                    cases where debt becomes unmanageable, debt counseling and restructuring options can help
                    individuals regain financial stability.</p>
                <h3>Effective Strategies:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a monthly budget and stick to it.</li>
                    <li>Pay off high-interest debts first (debt avalanche method).</li>
                    <li>Consider consolidating debts for easier repayment.</li>
                    <li>Negotiate with creditors for better terms if struggling.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>📊 Debt Management: Snowball vs Avalanche</h3>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> John has the following debts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Student Loan: ₹4,00,000 at 10% interest</li>
                        <li>Car Loan: ₹2,00,000 at 8% interest</li>
                        <li>Credit Card Bill: ₹1,00,000 at 18% interest</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Debt Snowball Method:</strong> Pays off ₹1,00,000 first, then ₹2,00,000, then ₹4,00,000.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Debt Avalanche Method:</strong> Pays off ₹1,00,000 (18% interest) first to save on
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>The **Avalanche Method** saves more money in the long run.</p>
