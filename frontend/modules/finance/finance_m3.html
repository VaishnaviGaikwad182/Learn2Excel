    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="container">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Have you ever wondered why some people achieve financial security while others struggle despite earning well?
        The key is investing. Saving money is important, but simply saving won’t grow your wealth. Investing makes your
        money work for you and helps beat inflation.</p>
      <p>Imagine planting a mango seed. If you care for it, it grows into a tree that gives you fruit year after year.
        Similarly, investing today can give you returns for years to come.</p>

    <!-- Why Should You Invest? -->
    <section class="container">
      <h2>Why Should You Invest?</h2>
      <p>Saving in a bank is safe but offers limited growth. Investments provide higher returns and help you achieve
        long-term financial goals.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Beat Inflation</li>
        <li>Grow Your Wealth</li>
        <li>Achieve Financial Goals</li>
        <li>Generate Passive Income</li>
        <li>Gain Financial Freedom</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> ₹1 lakh invested in a mutual fund with a 12% return grows to ₹3.1 lakh in 10 years.
      </p>

    <!-- Types of Investments (Grid Boxes) -->
    <section class="container">
      <h2>Types of Investments</h2>
      <p>Investing your money is an effective way to grow your wealth and achieve financial security over time. There
        are various types of investment options available, each with different levels of risk and return. Understanding
        these investment types helps you make better decisions depending on your financial goals and risk tolerance.</p>
      <br>

      <div class="types-container">

        <div class="investment-box low-risk">
          <h3>Fixed Deposits (FDs)</h3>
          <p>One of the most common and safest investments is Fixed Deposits (FDs), where you deposit a fixed sum in a
            bank for a specific time and earn a guaranteed interest. It is low-risk but offers moderate returns.</p>
          <p class="rate">Returns: 5% - 7%</p>
        </div>

        <div class="investment-box low-risk">
          <h3>Public Provident Fund (PPF)</h3>
          <p>Public Provident Fund (PPF) is another secure, government-backed scheme ideal for long-term savings,
            providing decent returns with tax benefits.</p>
          <p class="rate">Returns: 7% - 8%</p>
        </div>

        <div class="investment-box medium-risk">
          <h3>Mutual Funds</h3>
          <p>Mutual Funds pool money from many investors and invest it in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.
            These are managed by professional fund managers and can provide higher returns than traditional saving
            schemes, although they carry market risks.</p>
          <p class="rate">Returns: 8% - 15%</p>
        </div>

        <div class="investment-box high-risk">
          <h3>Stocks / Equity</h3>
          <p>For those willing to take higher risks, investing directly in Stocks offers the chance for high returns by
            purchasing shares of companies. However, stocks are volatile and require careful research.</p>
          <p class="rate">Returns: Variable</p>
        </div>

        <div class="investment-box medium-risk">
          <h3>Real Estate</h3>
          <p>Real Estate is a physical investment where you buy property to earn rental income or benefit from price
            appreciation over time. It generally requires significant capital but offers long-term value and inflation
            protection.</p>
          <p class="rate">Returns: 8% - 12%</p>
        </div>

        <div class="investment-box low-risk">
          <h3>Gold</h3>
          <p>Gold is a traditional investment in India, valued for its security and hedge against inflation. Nowadays,
            gold investments can be made through physical gold, Gold ETFs, or Sovereign Gold Bonds. </p>
          <p class="rate">Returns: 6% - 10%</p>

    <!-- Risk and Return -->
    <section class="container">
      <h2>Understanding Risk & Return</h2>
      <p>All investments carry risk. The higher the risk, the higher the potential returns. Knowing your risk tolerance
        helps you make better investment choices.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Low Risk = Low Return (FDs, PPF)</li>
        <li>Medium Risk = Medium Return (Debt Funds, Gold)</li>
        <li>High Risk = High Return (Stocks, Equity Mutual Funds)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <strong> 👉 Risk Tolerance depends on: </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Your age (young investors can take more risks).</li>
        <li>Financial goals (retirement needs less risk closer to retirement age).</li>
        <li>Your comfort level with losses.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>🔹 Example:

        Younger investors may put 70% in equity, 30% in debt.

        Retired individuals might prefer 80% debt, 20% equity.</p>

    <!-- SIP and Compounding -->
    <section class="container">
      <h2>SIP & Power of Compounding</h2>
      <h3>SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)</h3>
      <p>A Systematic Investment Plan, commonly known as SIP, is an investment strategy where an investor deposits a
        fixed amount of money at regular intervals (usually monthly or quarterly) into a mutual fund. SIPs are designed
        to instill disciplined investing habits while reducing the risk of market volatility. By investing small amounts
        regularly instead of a large lump sum, investors benefit from something called Rupee Cost Averaging. This means
        they purchase more units when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high, which averages out the cost
        of investment over time. SIPs are convenient, automated, and affordable, making them ideal for salaried
        individuals or anyone seeking a hassle-free investment approach.</p>
      <p>For example, if you invest ₹2,000 every month in an equity mutual fund that gives an average return of 12%
        annually, after 10 years you would have invested ₹2.4 lakh (₹2,000 x 12 months x 10 years). However, the power
        of returns can grow your money to over ₹7 lakh. If you continue for 20 years, your total investment of ₹4.8 lakh
        can grow to more than ₹19 lakh, demonstrating the benefit of staying invested longer.</p>
      <h3>Power of Compounding</h3>
      <p>The Power of Compounding refers to the process where the earnings on an investment generate their own earnings.
        In simple terms, it is "interest on interest." When the returns earned on your investment are reinvested instead
        of withdrawn, they start to earn returns themselves, which leads to exponential growth of your wealth over time.
        The key factor in compounding is time; the earlier you start, the more time your investment has to grow.</p>
      <p>For instance, if you invest ₹1 lakh at a 10% annual return, at the end of Year 1, you’ll have ₹1.1 lakh. In
        Year 2, you will earn interest on ₹1.1 lakh, growing it to ₹1.21 lakh. Over 10 years, this becomes ₹2.59 lakh,
        and after 20 years, it can grow to ₹6.73 lakh. The magic of compounding works best when you stay invested for a
        longer duration and reinvest your earnings. </p>

    <!-- Diversification -->
    <section class="container">
      <h2>Building a Diversified Portfolio</h2>
      <p>Diversification spreads risk across different assets, reducing the impact of market fluctuations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Equities (Growth)</li>
        <li>Debt (Stability)</li>
        <li>Gold (Inflation Hedge)</li>
        <li>Real Estate (Asset Growth)</li>
        <li>Emergency Fund (Liquidity)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <strong>Sample Portfolio by Age</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Age 20-30: 70% Equity, 20% Debt, 10% Gold</li>
        <li>Age 30-40: 60% Equity, 30% Debt, 10% Gold</li>
        <li>Age 50+: 30% Equity, 50% Debt, 10% Gold, 10% Real Estate</li>
      </ul>
