            <h2>6.1 What is Insurance?</h2>
            <p>Insurance is a financial agreement where a policyholder pays a premium to an insurance company in
                exchange for coverage against specific risks.</p>

            <h3>How Insurance Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Premium Payment:</b> The policyholder regularly pays a fixed amount (monthly, quarterly, or
                    annually) to keep the policy active.</li>
                <li><b>Risk Pooling:</b> Insurers collect premiums from many policyholders and create a financial pool
                    to compensate for claims.</li>
                <li><b>Claim Process:</b> If the insured event occurs (e.g., accident, illness, death), the policyholder
                    or beneficiaries can file a claim to receive financial compensation.</li>
                <li><b>Settlement:</b> The insurer verifies the claim and disburses the amount as per policy terms.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Insurance protects individuals from financial hardships by distributing risks across many people,
                ensuring that a single unfortunate event does not cause extreme financial distress.</p>

        <!-- Risk Management Strategies -->
        <section class="box">
            <h2>6.5 Risk Management Strategies</h2>
            <p>Risk management involves minimizing financial risks and potential losses. Here are key strategies:</p>

            <div class="strategy">
                <h3>1. Build an Emergency Fund</h3>
                <p>Save at least 3-6 months' worth of expenses to handle unexpected situations like job loss, medical
                    emergencies, or car repairs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="strategy">
                <h3>2. Diversify Investments</h3>
                <p>Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate to reduce financial risk. Avoid
                    putting all your money into one investment option.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="strategy">
                <h3>3. Buy Adequate Insurance</h3>
                <p>Ensure you have the right type and amount of insurance to protect your income, health, and assets.
                    Underinsurance can lead to major financial losses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="strategy">
                <h3>4. Adopt a Healthy Lifestyle</h3>
                <p>Maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid smoking/alcohol to reduce health risks. A
                    healthy lifestyle lowers medical expenses and improves life expectancy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="strategy">
                <h3>5. Use Safe Financial Practices</h3>
                <p>Avoid unnecessary debt and high-interest loans. Maintain a good credit score by paying bills on time
                    and managing credit responsibly. Set financial goals and stick to a budget.</p>
