        Indian cuisine is rich and diverse, known for its bold flavors, aromatic
        spices, and unique cooking techniques. This guide will help you
        understand the essentials if you are new to Indian cooking from
        must-have kitchen tools to fundamental techniques. With the right
        knowledge and preparation, you can confidently create authentic Indian
        dishes in your own kitchen.
      </p>
      <h2>Essential Kitchen Tools</h2>
      <p>
        Indian cuisine needs some specialized equipment to ensure the process is
        efficient and enjoyable. The equipment assists in grinding, rolling, and
        cooking food to get the right texture and taste.
      </p>

        alt="utensils"
        width="400"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Gas Stove –</strong> A gas stove is the main cooking device in
          most Indian kitchens, providing precise temperature control for
          various cooking methods such as frying, boiling, and simmering.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rolling Pin & Board(Chakla & Belan) –</strong> These utensils
          are used to make flatbreads such as chapatis, parathas, and puris. The
          rolling pin (belan) flattens the dough evenly, and the board (chakla)
          serves as a firm surface for rolling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tava (Griddle) –</strong> Tava is a circular, flat pan used to
          prepare rotis, dosas, and parathas. It provides even heat and makes it
          possible to achieve the ideal texture for Indian flatbreads.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heavy-Bottomed Pan(Kadhai) –</strong> A heavy, thick-bottomed
          pan is indispensable for frying curries, stir-fries, and deep-fried
          snacks. It distributes heat evenly and avoids burning the food, which
          is necessary for slow-cooked dishes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cutlery –</strong> Fundamental cutlery such as spoons, forks,
          and ladles is required to mix, stir, and serve food. Other spoons such
          as slotted and deep spoons are suitable for other needs in cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pressure Cooker –</strong> Pressure cooker is a common
          appliance in every Indian kitchen, as it shortens the cooking time of
          lentils (dals), rice, and meat considerably. It preserves nutrients
          while making sure grains and legumes are perfectly cooked.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spice Box (Masala Dabba) –</strong> A masala dabba is a
          stainless steel, round spice box having various small compartments to
          keep fundamental Indian spices like cumin, turmeric, coriander, chili
          powder, and mustard seeds. Organizing spices makes cooking more
          effective.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mortar and Pestle –</strong> A mortar and pestle is a
          must-have tool for grinding fresh spices, preparing pastes, and
          crushing ingredients such as garlic, ginger, and chilies. Although
          pre-ground spices can be used, freshly ground spices add much more
          aroma and flavor to Indian dishes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blender (Mixer Grinder)–</strong> A mixer grinder or blender
          is a must for blending smooth spice pastes, chutneys, and grinding
          masalas. It saves time and effort while preparing ingredients for
          Indian recipes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chopping Board –</strong> Strong chopping board offers a safe
          platform for cutting vegetables, fruits, and meat. Having a different
          board for cutting vegetables and meat avoids cross-contamination.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Knife –</strong> Good-quality, sharp knife is needed for
          chopping vegetables, cutting meat, and preparing ingredients in an
          efficient way. A well-maintained knife makes cooking safer and more
          precise.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Kitchen Hygiene and Safety</h2>
      <p>
        Cooking has to be safe and hygienic. Some basic safety and cleanliness
        tips are as follows:
      </p>

      <h3>Safety Handling of Knife</h3>
      <p>
        Handling a sharp knife on a firm cutting board guarantees precise and
        safe cutting. Always cut in the direction away from your body and keep
        fingers curled inward so that there are no accidental injuries. Store
        the knives securely when not in use so that there are no accidents.

      </div>
      <h3>Safe Cooking Practices</h3>
      <p>
        Take care when using hot oil, as it splatters. Use a deep pan and a long
        spoon to reduce risks. Avoid flammable materials near the stove, and
        double-check gas burners after use. When using a pressure cooker, lock
        the lid properly and release steam properly.
      </p>
      <div class="card" onclick="openModal('burns')">
        <div class="card-title">🚑First Aid: Burns</div>
      </div>
      <h3>Storing Ingredients Properly</h3>
      <p>
        Proper storage maintains ingredients fresh and safe to consume. Store
        spices in sealed containers out of moisture and direct sunlight to
        preserve their strength. Refrigerate perishables such as dairy, fresh
        herbs, and leftovers immediately to avoid spoilage.
      </p>
      <h3>Having a Clean Kitchen</h3>
      <p>
        Keeping your kitchen clean inhibits contamination and ensures food
        safety. Wash hands before and after food handling. Clean cutting boards
        and countertops daily to prevent cross-contamination. Clean utensils
        thoroughly after handling to ensure cleanliness.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Cooking Methods</h2>
      <p>
        Mastering basic techniques will enhance your Indian cooking experience.
      </p>
      <h3>Simple Tadka (Tempering) Flow</h3>
      <p>
        Tempering (tadka) is a basic method employed in Indian cooking to add
        depth to flavors.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Place oil or ghee in a pan.</li>
        <li>Add mustard or cumin seeds.</li>
        <li>
          When they splutter, add aromatics such as ginger, garlic, or onions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add tomatoes and ground spices such as turmeric, chili powder, and
          garam masala.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Indian Bread Preparations</h3>
      <p>
        Flatbreads such as chapati and paratha need kneaded dough. Allow dough
        to rest prior to rolling in order to be soft
      </p>
      <h3>Cooking Rice & Daal</h3>
      <p>
        Soak lentils and rice prior to cooking to enhance texture and speed up
        cooking. This will aid grains to cook evenly and not become too
        starchey.
