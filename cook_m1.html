            dishes in your own kitchen.</p>
        <h2>Essential Kitchen Tools</h2>
        <p>Indian cuisine needs some specialized equipment to ensure the process is efficient and enjoyable. 
            The equipment assists in grinding, rolling, and cooking food to get the right texture and taste.</p>

        <img src="utensils.png" alt="utensils" width="400">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gas Stove –</strong> A gas stove is the main cooking device in most Indian kitchens, providing precise temperature control for various cooking methods such as frying, boiling, and simmering.</li>
            <li><strong>Rolling Pin & Board(Chakla & Belan) –</strong> These utensils are used to make flatbreads such as chapatis, parathas, and puris. The rolling pin (belan) flattens the dough evenly, and the board (chakla) serves as a firm surface for rolling.</li>
            <li><strong>Tava (Griddle) –</strong> Tava is a circular, flat pan used to prepare rotis, dosas, and parathas. It provides even heat and makes it possible to achieve the ideal texture for Indian flatbreads.</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy-Bottomed Pan(Kadhai) –</strong> A heavy, thick-bottomed pan is indispensable for frying curries, stir-fries, and deep-fried snacks. It distributes heat evenly and avoids burning the food, which is necessary for slow-cooked dishes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cutlery –</strong> Fundamental cutlery such as spoons, forks, and ladles is required to mix, stir, and serve food. Other spoons such as slotted and deep spoons are suitable for other needs in cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>Pressure Cooker –</strong> Pressure cooker is a common appliance in every Indian kitchen, as it shortens the cooking time of lentils (dals), rice, and meat considerably. It preserves nutrients while making sure grains and legumes are perfectly cooked.</li>
            <li><strong>Spice Box (Masala Dabba) –</strong> A masala dabba is a stainless steel, round spice box having various small compartments to keep fundamental Indian spices like cumin, turmeric, coriander, chili powder, and mustard seeds. Organizing spices makes cooking more effective.</li>
            <li><strong>Mortar and Pestle –</strong> A mortar and pestle is a must-have tool for grinding fresh spices, preparing pastes, and crushing ingredients such as garlic, ginger, and chilies. Although pre-ground spices can be used, freshly ground spices add much more aroma and flavor to Indian dishes.</li>
            <li><strong>Blender (Mixer Grinder)–</strong> A mixer grinder or blender is a must for blending smooth spice pastes, chutneys, and grinding masalas. It saves time and effort while preparing ingredients for Indian recipes.</li>
            <li><strong>Chopping Board –</strong> Strong chopping board offers a safe platform for cutting vegetables, fruits, and meat. Having a different board for cutting vegetables and meat avoids cross-contamination.</li>
            <li><strong>Knife –</strong> Good-quality, sharp knife is needed for chopping vegetables, cutting meat, and preparing ingredients in an efficient way. A well-maintained knife makes cooking safer and more precise.</li>
        </ul>
